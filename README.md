# Gaussian elimination
Solves system of linear equations by Gaussian elimination. Takes number of equations (n) and (n+1)Ã—n coefficients as an input. Prints n values as a solution.

Example input:
```
  3

  3     2    -1     1
  2    -2     4    -2
 -1     0.5  -1     0
```
Example output:
```
 1.000000
-2.000000
-2.000000
```
